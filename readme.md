## Tutoring.UP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ddmler/tutoringup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ddmler/tutoringup)

University Project featuring continuous deployment, a dev VM bundled, moodle single sign-on integration and more. Goal was to create a simple project using modern tools.

There is a short presentation in german about it available [here](tutoringup.pdf).

Live demo available on: [Heroku](https://tutoringup.herokuapp.com/) (you have to wait a moment while the vm boots up)
